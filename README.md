# CLI Banking System (Java)

This is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) Banking System** developed in Java. It simulates basic banking operations like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking â€” all accessible via a terminal-based interface.

This was my **first Java project**, built to learn object-oriented programming and console-based interaction.
